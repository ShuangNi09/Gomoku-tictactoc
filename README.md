This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I followed the instruction on this [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). I changed the 3X3 board to 10X10 board and make the winning rule as 5 Xs or Os on the same line. The history is stored and the player can go back to any step.

The board looks like:
